Input images
Find two interesting images to use. They should be color, rectangular in shape (NOT square). Pick one that is wide and one tall.
You might find some classic vision examples here. Or take your own. Make sure the image width or height do not exceed 512 pixels.
Output: Store the two images as ps0-1-a-1.png and ps0-1-a-2.png inside the output folder

Arithmetic and Geometric operations
What is the min and max of the pixel values of img1_green? What is the mean? What is the standard deviation?  And how did you compute these?
Output: Text response, with code snippets
Subtract the mean from all pixels, then divide by standard deviation, then multiply by 10 (if your image is 0 to 255) or by 0.05 (if your image ranges from 0.0 to 1.0). Now add the mean back in.
Output: ps0-4-b-1.png
Shift img1_green to the left by 2 pixels.
Output: ps0-4-c-1.png
Subtract the shifted version of img1_green from the original, and save the difference image.
Output: ps0-4-d-1.png (make sure that the values are legal when you write the image so that you can see all relative differences), text response: What do negative pixel values mean anyways?
